This project is a study about how we can use the XML (Extensible Markup Language) to create a framework and a full environment for the (ANN) Artificial Neural Networks, topology, Learning Algorithms, and testing, then use the Networks in Real Applications. parallel machines, PCs, Embedded systems, Robots, and Electronic circuits.

This Framework  and environment can describe any ANN  architectures, learning algorithms and run it in simulator, then get it to the final steps, with all type of reports and figures.

Using UML language to mange the working in this project in the way wich make it easy to understand and have the management for Unix,  Linux, and Windows operating systems, and embedded systems.

Why XML with ANN?

We know that the
> ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) is a new grate science, and it has many descriptions, and implementations.

Every one describes it in his understanding, and he has his implementation code or circuits. So, we want to create standard description, and this description can apply for any ANN, Topology, Learning Algorithms, and run time using.

The latest technology of describing any thing is XML, but what is the XML? The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very flexible text format derived from SGML (ISO 8879). Originally designed to meet the challenges of large-scale electronic publishing, XML is also playing an increasingly important role in the exchange of a wide variety of data on the Web and elsewhere.

Most modern Frameworks like .NET and Java in Windows and KDE in Linux use the XML to describe projects and Compile or translate the Languages like C++, C# , Java, Basic to a specific version of XML, then tray to create the executable files.

So, here we have to set some standards format of XML Files, like main XML file of the project, and the training set file, Architecture Implement XML file, the Learning Algorithm XML file, and report files.

The GUI has to give us the ability to edit the XML Files in coding way or using the tools to help the programmers to do that in easy way.

I hope to make this project a standard interface for the neural networks in any machines, Robots, or real time applications.
